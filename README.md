# Levenshtein-Search-Algorithm
## Description

This Python project provides a Levenshtein distance calculator and a graphical user interface (GUI) for measuring string similarity. Levenshtein distance, also known as edit distance, quantifies the similarity between two strings by counting the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.

## Features

- Efficient Levenshtein distance calculation using dynamic programming.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for easy string similarity assessment.
- Support for both dark and light mode themes for the GUI.
- Ideal for integrating string similarity calculations into various projects.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Enter the documents in `levenshtein.py` file.
3. Run the `GUI.py` script to launch the graphical user interface.
4. Enter a string in the search box and click "Search" to rank documents based on string similarity using Levenshtein distance.
5. Toggle between dark and light mode themes with ease.
6. Explore and integrate the Levenshtein distance calculation algorithm from the `levenshtein.py` module into your own projects.
